# verilog-VGAbox
Pair assignment for a course in Verilog that implements a 640x480 60Hz VGA driver.


A red square is displayed on the screen. Four buttons can be used to move the square around smoothly,
or a switch can be flipped to start screensaver mode, where the square bounces around similar to screensavers on 
retro display units. 


Tested and works on PynqZ2 platform.
